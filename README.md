manipulating the URL gives different data -potentially other accounts:

downloading / combing through pcap files - useful info:

creds also work with ssh:

Looks like its a cpability exploit.

`cap_setuid` Allows a process to set its effective user ID, which can be used to gain the privileges of another user, including the root user.

From GTFObins:
If the binary has the Linux CAP_SETUID capability set or it is executed by another binary with the capability set, it can be used as a backdoor to maintain privileged access by manipulating its own process UID.
